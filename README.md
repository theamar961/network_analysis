# QUANTIFYING BUILDING DAMAGE USING SATELLITE IMAGERY

This project's goal is to use satellite imagery to understand building damage before and after disasters using the xBD Dataset.

# Dataset

We are using xBD, which is a large-scale dataset for the ad-
vancement of change detection and building damage assess-
ment. The dataset includes post-disaster imagery with trans-
posed polygons from before the disaster over the buildings,
as well as damage classification labels. The dataset provides
four damage categories - No Damage, Minor Damage, Major
Damage, and Destroyed for each building. Over 45,000KM2
of polygon labeled pre and post-disaster imagery is included
in the dataset. The xBD dataset is provided in the train, test
and holdout splits in a 80/10/10% ratio, respectively.
